			<h5>Article</h5>
			<p>Forty-eight hours after Hurricane Michael devastated Florida's Mexico Beach, 
			residents of this once-idyllic beach community are beginning to come to grips with the reality
			that much of their town is simply gone.</p>
			<p>Numerous homes in this resort town of about 1,200 were shattered into splinters or ripped from
			their foundations. One storm chaser said the area looked like a "nuclear bomb had gone off."</p>
			<p>Rescuers and residents are struggling to return to the town devastated by a direct hit from 
			the high-end Category 4 hurricane to assess the damage and search for the reported 285 people
			believed to have remained behind.</p>
			<p>Here are a few of the people who chose to ride out the storm in an around Mexico Beach and their stories of survival.</p>
